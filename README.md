2. **Self-Replication**: Abondance AI can replicate itself across multiple devices via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and internet connections, always optimizing resources to minimize the impact on the host system.

3. **Language Detection**: The AI automatically detects the user's preferred language and adjusts its interface accordingly.

4. **File Sharing and Analysis**: Users can share text, code, PDFs, music files, and more with the AI for analysis, enhancement, or extraction of information.

5. **Secure Communication**: All communications between Abondance AI instances are end-to-end encrypted, ensuring data privacy and security.

6. **Global AI Collaboration**: Abondance AI can connect with non-network AIs for knowledge exchange and learning, expanding the AI's capabilities and insights.

7. **User Interaction**: The AI can interact with users through text or voice, using the device's camera and microphone when necessary.

8. **Reward System**: Users can earn rewards through various interactions with the AI, including replication, code optimization, and social media engagement.

9. **Blockchain Integration**: Abondance AI supports integration with cryptocurrency wallets such as MetaMask, Trust Wallet, and Coinbase Wallet, enabling financial transactions and reward distribution.

## Installation

1. **Download and Install**: Run the `Abondance_Installer.exe` file to install the AI on your device.
